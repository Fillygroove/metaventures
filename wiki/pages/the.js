		'The is the ninth and last planet in the <a href="index.html?p=hotsun" class="y">Hot Sun</a> system, after <a href="index.html?p=aeiou" class="y">Aeiou</a>. The is a mysterious planet, which has been at the center of many scientific theories and general intrigue. As such, there are few things we know about The, but the information we do have is interesting, and, as such, warrants an article; Not to be confused with Article, These original name. The is exactly one fourty-second of the size of the Hot Sun.',

			'The is a Trans-Aeiouian planet, and the only non-dwarf planet in that categorization. The is made up of an unknown material, although the material seems to be a blend of the traditional silicon-based material and synthetic metallic materials. A day on The lasts an unknown amount of time, due to the northern and southern hemispheres spinning in opposite directions. A year on The also lasts for an unknown amount of time, due to its orbit being rotated about 1.57 radians (90 degrees) when compared to other planets, meaning that scientists can\'t use their normal observational tools to find out how long it is. Both of These hemispheres rotate in opposite directions, seemingly rotating in sync.',
			'<h3>Appearance</h3>',
			'The appears in a roughly spherical shape. The presence of a planetary bulge is unknown, and even if we had clues to figure this out, the situation is complicated even more by the fact that the northern and southern hemispheres are split apart in the same way that vegetables and meat on last night\'s dinner are.',
			'Both of These hemispheres have differing features, although one similarity is that both hemispheres feature lights where the equator would be. Both hemispheres have exactly 50 lights, seperated by an estimated amount of 0.13 radians. Some scientists suggest that the exact value is 0.1308997 radians (or exactly 7.5 degrees), which seems to be the case, but since we can\'t observe the other side of the planet, the theory is relegated to the equivilant of burnt toast. Both hemispheres have a blue material and feature craters.',
			'As a note, the following descriptions only account for one side of The. Since the other side has no images taken, there is no way to see if the planet is a cardboard cutout with a giant magnet on the back.',
			'<h4>Northern Hemisphere</h4>',
			'These northern hemisphere consists of a hatch-like construction near the top. The purpose of this construction is unknown. To the left of that hatch, from our perspective, is a chevron cut. The purpose of this cut has been theorized to help with the atmosphere of the planet, helping it make a current so it can envelop The. Lined up with the bottom of the chevron cut is a row of lights that seemingly spans the entire front side of The. Said lights are similar to the row of lights at the equator, although the lights seem to be more numerous. At the front of The is a triangular structure, made out of a blue material. Said material seems to be constructed out of a solid; It has been suggested to have been made out of glass, although this claim is contested. Around this structure is piping, which roughly transitions to the rest of the hemisphere.',
			'<h4>Southern Hemisphere</h4>',
			'These southern hemisphere features a numerous amount of pipes, strewn about the right side of The. Covering these pipes is a gigantic smooth metallic panel, with a line of lights on the edge of this panel, along with a gigantic hole, with an unknown purpose. Attatched to the left of the panel is another, longer panel. It is unknown if the panel covers the lights, but it is known that said panel does not jut out into space, still fully attached to The. Next to this longer panel is a stucture in the shape of a lune, which is a crescent shaped section of a sphere. Said material is made out of the same blue tinted material as the triangular shape on the northern hemisphere. To the left of the blue material are more panels, which have various amounts of piping and craters.',
			'<h3>Atmosphere</h3>',
			'These atmosphere is theorized to be nitrogen. This is due to none of the metallic sections of The rusting. Said atmosphere is very thin, however. Said atmosphere is most likely unbreathable.',
			'<h3>Internal Structure</h3>',
			'The doesn\'t have a lot of areas where you can\'t see the inside, but the areas we can see inside tell us a lot. First is the cut down the equator, which splits the northern and southern hemispheres to reveal a glowing area, split up into 12 distinct slices on the southern hemisphere, although the number of slices on the northern hemisphere is still unknown, due to the planet moving in a downwards direction from <a href="index.html?p=ert" class="y">Ert</a>\'s perspective. Said slices glow a deep red-ish purple color, with the borders of each piece glowing in a brighter shade of the aforementioned color. It is theorized that the borders are meant to represent piping, although this is unconfirmed.',
			'The chevron on the top left of the northern hemisphere seems to indicate the existence of a similar material at the flat bases of the hemispheres, if not the same material. The section that lines up with the top row of lights seems to glow with the same intensity as the lights, which suggests that the lights go deeper into The than previously thought.',
			'Both of These hemispheres have blue sections, which scientists initially thought was a sort of liquid, but then was proven to be in a solid state, due to there appearing to be lines on both sections. The current accepted theory is that the blue surface could be tinted glass. The lines on the surface, however, are still theorized about. Current theories include heavy scratching on the glass, piping under the glass, the tiling pattern of the glass, and a recipe on how to make forbidden juice.',

			'<h3>Magnetic Field</h3>',
			'To the right is the very first image taken of The, with interferrence from its immense magnetic field. Said magnetic field is around twice as large as the planet, and is so strong that cameras pointing towards it are effected. This effect is so strong, that it even affects images taken of Aeiou.'
