Ayduno is a terrestrial world, with a makeup similar to <a href="index.html?p=george">George</a>, with a lot of land and little to no water. Ayduno\'s tilt is very shallow. The prescence of a magnetic field is unknown, although if it did have one, it would be weak. Ayduno features 3 rings, although they aren\'t the typical rings. These rings move around the planet in a circular motion, and the center ring periodically crashes into the planet every couple of hours, mostly on the equator.',
