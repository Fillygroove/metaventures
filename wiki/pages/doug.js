Doug can be seen in the night skies of <a href="index.html?p=ert">Ert</a> during the evenings, although it is hard to see due to it not having much of a reflective surface. As such, Doug is often forgotten and even hated due to its status as a planet.',

			'<h3>Appearance</h3>',
			'Doug, like all worlds in the inner system, is a terrestrial planet. It is a deep brown and yellow rocky body covered in large dark craters and volcanic planita. Doug is about one hundredth the size of the Hot Sun. It has a small axial tilt of about 0.05 radians and rotates once every 20 days in the opposite direction from all other worlds.',
			'<h3>Geography</h3>',
			'Doug\'s most notable features are its diverse patches of yellows, tans, and browns. It features a few massive craters that scar the surface with dark patches. Its surface is an entirely solid landscape full of jagged mountains, ridges, plains, and craters from ancient collisions.',
			'Doug\'s surface color is thought to be formed from Grēne\'s ejected atmosphere, reacting with exposed regolith and turning it brown. The varied colors on Doug can be used to find out the age of the surface, darker sections being the newest and with lighter sections being the oldest.',
			'The largest craters of Doug span hundreds of kilometers, and are often accompanied by flat featureless plains of newer rock, suggesting at one point these vast sections were molten presumably by impacts or from volcanism.',
			'Near the south pole of Doug lies a crater that is light in color. This spot has not been given a label, due to it only being observed once.',
			'<h3>"Atmosphere" and Climate</h3>',
			'Doug has a very thin atmosphere, although it\'s not enough to cause a visible sky. Said atmosphere is theorized to have come from Grēne\'s atmosphere, along with the trapping of other gasses.',
			'<h3>Magnetic Field</h3>',
			'Doug lacks a proper magnetosphere, which means it can\'t block solar radiation from bombarding its surface. Wear sunscreen.',
			'<h3>Internal Structure</h3>',
			'Doug\'s surface suggests that there was some form of volcanic activity, but there are no current observations of it. Its lack of a magnetic field, atmosphere, and the presence of craters deptics Doug as an inactive geologic body. Its interior is thought to be solid with little warmth left inside.',
			'Doug may also contain large cavernous remains of volcanic activity, and the disputed worms that could have created these.'

		info: [
			'Doug\'s orbit is often dragged around a lot by the other nearby planets, most noteworthy is Pilf and the Ert and <a href="index.html?p=george">George</a> system. Grēne may have an impact depending on when it aligns itself with the other planets. Despite this, its orbit remains stable.',
			'<h3>Interactions With Grēne</h3>',
			'Doug orbits closely to the expelled atmosphere of Grēne, which, over millions of years, has turned it to the brown shade we know it as today.',
			'<h3>Interactions With Ert</h3>',
			'Doug indirectly interacted with the cultures on Ert, so technically it made one.'

			'<h3>Aech</h3>',
			'Doug has one confirmed satellite, which has been named Aech. Aech is a natural satellite, shaped like a cube. It is the only object in the system with a cuboid shape, along with Pilf. Aech itself contains a similar makeup to Doug, with the same type of rocks and similar craters, with the only difference being size and shape.'

		name: 'Life',
		info: [
			'<h3>Worms</h3>',
			'Theoretically, Doug could have life on it. While unconfirmed as of now, Doug could have gigantic lengthy creatures on it that seem to be a larger variant of George\'s worms. Said worms could have created the holes on Doug as a place to call home. This theory also applies to Aech.'
		]
	}, {
		name: 'Culture',
		info: [
			'Doug is widely regarded to be the least favored planet in the Hot Sun system. This is due to it appearing to be just a rock, although there is much more than that. It is widely hated due to the opinion on scientists. A quote, which has been debated by critics, is down below.',
			'"Doug, are you KIDDING ME? Why can\'t this damn planet make VOLCANOES already! I want to see some action, not a dead dirtball of a planet! I don\'t even want to call it a planet, it\'s just a rock. It has absolutely no value to my research."',
