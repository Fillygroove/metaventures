Reasons include the periodic DIE bursts that cut off satellite communication or that it serves no purpose in figuring out new physics.

			'<h3>Compared to Other Planets...</h3>',
			[
				'Doug is the second smallest terrestrial planet.',
				'By size it is the tenth largest planet.',
				'By mass it is the ninth largest planet.',
				'By density, Doug is in fifth place.',
				'By distance to Ommadawn, Doug is second.',

			'Unsurprisingly, Doug\'s placement is average and unremarkable. Being the best at being forgotten!',
			'<h3>Orbit And Rotation</h3>',
			'Doug resides in a balmy distance from Ommadawn, just far enough to not be melted by the heat, <i>unfortunately</i>. It is closer to the sun compared to Mercury.',
			'Doug\'s orbit is nearly a perfect circle, which is surprising considering that it would often dragged around by the other nearby planets, most noteworthy is Grēne and the Ert and George binary. The overall stability of its placement may be a lucky coincidence.',
			'Doug\'s rotation is rather slow, possibly due to the way the planet was created, likely from a "cataclysmic" event. The rotation is so slow that only around one fifth of a day passes when compared to a year on Doug. If you were born on Doug, you\'d be one year old before you\'d be one day old.',
			'One of the few interesting side-effects of Doug\'s slow rotation is that if you avoid all warnings and stand on its surface, Ommadawn will appear to freeze in the sky at certain points of the day.',
			'<h3>Geography</h3>',
			'Doug\'s most notable features are its patches of yellows, tans, and browns. It features a few massive craters that scar the surface with dark basins. Its surface is an entirely solid landscape full of jagged mountains, ridges, plains, and craters from ancient collisions.',
			'A group of three craters (pictured at the middle-left of the image of Doug used in the infobox), which, from left to right, are named Mer, Z, and Bau. These craters lack any evidence of impact, suggesting that the formation of these craters come from inside of the planet.',
			'The brighter patches seem to be older than the darker patches, hinting on Doug\'s more active past.',
			'<h3>Geology</h3>',
			'Given the clues on its surface, Doug may have had an active interior. It is likely that it has a crust and mantle, with a liquid core of metals. It may be porus inside.',
			'Once every Ert year, Doug emits a large burst of energy, referred to as a DIE Burst (Doug Internet EMP Burst). This burst of energy cuts out all forms of communication around Ert, which gives people a good reason to hate it, as if they didn\'t have a good enough reason in the past.',
			'The source of these bursts are unknown, and most current models suggest that they shouldn\'t be possible. They appear to be strongest within the large craters, and the trajectory of these bursts face only towards the Ert and George binary, even when Doug is at opposition.',
			'<h3>Magnetic Field</h3>',
			'Doug has a weak magnetic field, almost capable of deflecting charged particles from Ommadawn. During a DIE Burst, the strength of this field is increased by over a million times. How this field came to be is beyond anyone\'s knowledge, likely due to nobody caring enough.',
			'<h3>Atmosphere and Climate</h3>',
			'Doug has an exosphere, which does nothing and practically does not exist. Scientists theorize that the exosphere comes from Doug capturing bits of Grēne\'s ejected atmosphere. This may be the explanation of Doug\'s brown surface, being the result of gradual interactions from the trail.',
			'Surface temperatures of Doug would be blistering hot or freezing cold. Since there is no medium to have heat transfer, it would be equivalent to being in a vacuum. Climates vary little, only determined by how much light a certain part of the planet may receive. Doug\'s slow rotation would result in long days and nights, fluctuating between both extremes.',
			'Doug is considered the second-hottest planet overall, although it is still far behind Grēne by a longshot.',
			'<h3>Satellites</h3>',
			'The only confirmed moon is Aech, which resembles Doug but also happens to be in the shape of a cube, similar to that of Pilf. Aech is tiny and orbits barely a Doug radius away from the surface.',
			'Surrounding Doug is a dispersed asteroid field, ranging from a few meters to almost a kilometer in size. These rocks are believed to be fragments from the moon Aech as it approaches Doug and gets ripped apart by its gravity. This may form a ring around Doug.',
			'As Doug hasn\'t been investigated much by modern day scientists, it is unknown if more than one moon existed in the past.',
			'<h3>Life</h3>',
			'Doug\'s surface conditions are hazardous to most forms of life. Surface temperatures would burn or freeze anything that dares to traverse on its surface. Without a sufficient atmosphere or a proper form of radiation protection, most life would die.', 
			'Despite the inhospitality on its surface, there may be a worm-like creature borrowing beneath the surface. While unconfirmed as of now, these "worms" would be the reason why there are deep holes in Doug. This theory is also applicable to Aech.',
			'Most scientists would confidently say that there\'s nothing to see here, and would promptly tell you to defenestrate yourself.',
			'<h3>Symbol</h3>',
			'Doug\'s symbol represents an upside-down question mark, which refers to the fact that every question about Doug is unceremoniously cast away in the downstairs trash can. There may have been a different symbol for it in the past.'

		name: 'Culture',
		info: [
			'Doug is universally regarded to be the least favored planet according to the general demographics of Ert cultures. It is widely hated due to the opinion of scientists, claiming there is little incentive for any form of science other than protection from the notorious DIE bursts. Doug is the least visited planet in the Hot Sun system.',
			'In the Reegublic Zodiacal Calendar, the first month of the year is Doug. It has been tradition for those who were born during this time to be tossed into a dumpster. Regulations changed that rule to offer a bag of tricks to the recipient who was born in Doug annually.',
			'<h3>The DeeCee</h3>',
			'The routinely teased "Doug" generations formed a collective called the "Doug Club" or DeeCee to prove the notion of Doug\'s hate to be unjust. This group comprises many Doug enthusiasts willing to learn much of everything there is to be discovered from the planet. The DeeCee has managed to earn enough support from the vastly criticised Nyork Administration and Alphabet\'s Business Concern to send a probed mission to Doug.',
			'The term "Forgettable" was an agreed replacement to the term "Dougian" in order to sway away the general public opinion to not be reminded of the word "Doug" in describing things related to Doug\'s parameters. Strangely for the DeeCee, saying "Forgettable" often is seen as a compliment and the speaker would receive praise in doing so.',
			'<h3>Exploration</h3>',
			'Exploring Doug is costly and difficult, requiring a lot of maneuvers to even approach it. There is danger of potential collisions with Doug\'s asteroid field and the DIE bursts, which at this distance would be lethal for any unprepared mission.',
			'Doug only received two missions: The Forgotten Explorer, and the mission profile for Janet.',
			'The Forgotten Explorer was a successful mission by the DeeCee, imaging and mapping most of Doug\'s surface. It was eventually damaged by a DIE Burst and all communication to it was lost.',
			'There is little known about Janet and the mission to Doug.',
			'<h3>Scientists\' Opinion</h3>',
			'Physicists attribute Doug to being a useless asset in their quest of discovering and proving general relativity due to its circular orbit.',
			'Ground astronomers have a general distaste for Doug due to its dull non-reflective surface, which renders it mostly invisible when viewed in the evening skies of Ert.',
			'A professional baker once said that Doug would be the worst dessert to serve to children.',
			'A quote which has been highly debated by critics yet accepted by scientists may be read below.',
